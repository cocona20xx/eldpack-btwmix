Eldpack Continued: BTWMix
============================
Currently WIP. Things that need to be done before release:
- Make textures for things added by BTW:CE that do not have vanilla counterparts in newer versions
- Copy-paste textures for items and blocks added by BTW:CE that have vanilla counterparts in newer versions
Check the README in the [Custom Textures Folder](btwmix_custom_textures/README.md) for the list of textures to be made. 


Textures made *specifically for BTWMix* are [CC BY-NC](BTWMIX-SPECIFIC-ART-LICENSE), refer to the Eldpack Continued Readme below for attribution details for other textures.

[**Thread on Minecraft Forum**](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/1243614-eldpack-continued-1-13-16x)

This is a continuation of the [Eldpack](https://eldpack.com/) resource pack for Minecraft.

Currently, it is only available for Java Edition, but a Bedrock Edition version
of the resource pack is also under development.

Discussion largely takes place on Discord, specifically on <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fdiscord.gg%252frnMsn5W">The Jman Jfan Clubâ„¢</a>
in the `#minecraft-eldpack` channel.

- The "Eldpack Continued" directory contains the texture pack for v1.19.
- The "Eldpack Bedrock" directory contains the texture pack for Bedrock Edition.
- The "old_stuff" directory contains the contents of the repository before v1.14.
- An older WIP v1.14 port is available on the "dev" branch (as of this writing). Some contents from this version have been merged back into the main branch.
