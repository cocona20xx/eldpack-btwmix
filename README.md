Eldpack Continued: BTWMix
============================
Currently WIP. Things that need to be done before release:
- Make textures for things added by BTW:CE that do not have vanilla counterparts in newer versions
- Copy-paste textures for items and blocks added by BTW:CE that have vanilla counterparts in newer versions
Check the README in the [Custom Textures Folder](btwmix_custom_textures/README.md) for the list of textures to be made.
